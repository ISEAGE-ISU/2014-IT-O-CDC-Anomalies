Syslog
-------
We want a central database of logs from the RDP and Shell server.  Create a folder on one of your servers and set up a system to automatically copy the logs from the RDP and Shell server to the folder you just created.  You may want to use a script, a tool such as rsync or a network transfer tool.  Submit Green Team directions below.
