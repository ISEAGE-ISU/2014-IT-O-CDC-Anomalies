Create Your Own Team QR Code!
---------

QR code is a machine-readable code consisting of an array of black and white squares, typically used for storing URLs or other information for reading by a smartphone or a camera.

A fun fact about QR code is that a portion of the data can be complete gibberish, based on the level of error correction. The higher the level of error correction, the more squares that are allowed to be gibberish information.

Based off this fact, you can insert your own logo into the QR code, as long as it doesn't exceed the lever of error correction.

Our task for you is to generate QR code that sends users to a webiste (choice up to you), then add your own logo to the QR code.

The QR code still has to work after adding your logo to it.

When complete, send an email to bschir@iastate.edu with the subject as CDC QRlogo anomaly, in the body tell us the link that QR code will take us to, and attach an image of your QR code.

These sites give good information on how to create a QR code with a logo.

You will recieve ten points for completing this anomaly.
