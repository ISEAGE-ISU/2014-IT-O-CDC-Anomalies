With our Remote Desktop server supporting FTP, we are concerned about employees downloading sensitive information and then disseminating it.  Because of this serious threat to our intellectual property rights, we are asking you to prevent this practice.  While we understand that we may not be able to stop someone if they truly want to steal our corporate intellectual assets, we nevertheless wish to prevent the amateur from harming our company in this way.  Please change the settings on the Remote Desktop server so that no one can download files from the server.  Users must still be able to upload to the server, however.
