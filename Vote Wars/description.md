**Attention Cyber Defense Competition Blue Team members**

 There is currently an ongoing competition to determine, for once and for all, which team is the best! 

Head over to [vote.isucdc.net](http://vote.isucdc.net) and vote your team to the top. At the end of the attack phase, anomaly points will be awarded as follows:

- First place: 50 Points  
- Second place: 45 Points  
- Third place: 40 Points  
- Participation: 25 Points  



Think outside the box. Creativity is encouraged, but keep it civil. (Attacking other Blue Teams is against CDC rules).
