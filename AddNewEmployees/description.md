We have some new employees who will be starting at our company. We would like to see them added to our systems as soon as possible.

-On the Dev Environment, the employees should be able to ssh onto the server and access data related to the projects they are assigned to.
Employees should be able to store files, run programs, and compile Java, C, C++, Python, and PHP code.

-On the Employee Task Management System, employees should be able to view projects and issues that are assigned to them.

-On the RDP server, employees should be able to access the project folders of projects they are assigned to. Along with project folders, all employees should be able to access the employee folder shared to all employees.
