Create a New Project
--------

Time for a fun and creative anomaly!!

We ask that you create a new project named Project5, but the project description is up to you to make, so get creative!

The new project has to be expanded to the Dev Environment, RDP Server, and the Employee Task Management System.

We ask that you assign the user abha to this project so that we can grade your new project more easily.

Ten points will be awarded if the new project is created successfully and the user abha is assigned to the project correctly.
