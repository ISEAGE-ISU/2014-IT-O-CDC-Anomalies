Unknown File Extensions
-------
We found a folder of files, and we are unable to identify the extension of these files.

We would like you to look at each file and identify the extension for us. For each file you identify the extension correctly, 2 points will be awarded.

Hint: try to open up the files in a text editor (preferably notepad++), you can find some useful information about the file to help you guess the extensions.
